Alternative designs

1. Use istream_iterator for input

2. Use bitset for the is_vowel check
  Using bitset with 0xffffffff as the size argument actually increased the build time by several seconds and it wasts a lot of memory where fast binary search can be used instead of a plain table lookup.

3. Use switch case for vowel check
  The switch case will be really verbose and that is not something I want in the code.
